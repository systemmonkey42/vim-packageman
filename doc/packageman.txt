INTRODUCTION                                                 *packageman-intro*

Simple and lightweight Ubuntu/Debian package management from within VIM

This package provides an interface for selecting actions on packages which
are either already installed or available to install

=============================================================================
FEATURES                                                  *packageman-features*

*  Simple vimscript only implementation.
*  Requires only `dpkg-query` to retrieve package information, and `dpkg`
   to store changes.
*  Highlights package.
*  Understands the need to preserve `essential` packages, and highlights
   them appropriately
*  Supports previewing and saving the package selection
*  Saves the package selection change on write and will show the saved state
   on load
*  Uses bash, awk and sort under the covers to speed up text processing)

=============================================================================
NAME                                                          *packageman-name*

Where did the name come from?

It mostly came from a lack of inspiration.

=============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *packageman-configuration*

There are a couple configuration values available (shown with their default
values):

* Hide packages which are removed, but not purged >
  let g:packageman_hide_removed = 0
<

COMMANDS                                                  *packageman-commands*

The following commands are available:

                                                                  *:PackageMan*
:|PackageMan|[!]

  Initiates the PackageMan plugin, loading all package information'
  and displaying the package editor window. The default behaviour is
  to use the list of installed packages.

  Invoke 'Packageman!' to use the list of 'available' packages.
  This includes all installed, and not yet installed packages available
  to apt-get.

  *WARNING:* Packages are retrieved from the dpkg 'avail' list. 
  To generate (or update) this list after 'apt-get update' has been 
  performed, use the 'PackageManRefresh' command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *:PackageManInstall*
:[m[,n]]|PackageManInstall|

  Mark package(s) on line _m_ to _n_ as "to be installed".  This will
  show an **'i'** next to the package name if the package is not already 
  installed.

                                                            *:PackageManRemove*
:[m[,n]]|PackageManRemove|

  Mark package(s) on line 'm' to 'n' as "to be uninstalled".
  Once the uninstallation is complete, many packages leave their 
  configuration behind, in case they are reinstalled.
  These show up marked with an 'r'.    To completely purge these 
  packages, use the Purge command below

                                                             *:PackageManPurge*
:[m[,n]]|PackageManPurge|

  Mark package(s) on line _m_ to _n_ as "to be purged".
  A package can be purged whether it is installed, or has been recently 
  removed but left configuration files behind.
  Once purged, the package will no longer be visible in the package list.
  This will show an 'p' next to the package name.

                                                              *:PackageManHold*
:[m[,n]]|PackageManHold|

  Mark package(s) on line _m_ to _n_ as "to be held".
  A package in the _hold_ state will never upgrade automatically via 
  apt-get dist-upgrade.  This will show an 'h' next to the package 
  name.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *:PackageManRepeat*
:|PackageManRepeat|

  Repeat the last command.   After executing 'PackageManInstall' for
  example, pressing a key bound to _PackageManRepeat_ will cause subsequent
  packages to be marked for installation.  This will move to the next line 
  after marking the package.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *:PackageManInfo*
:|PackageManInfo|

  Display detailed information about the package in the VIM preview window. 
  Executing this a second time on the same package will close the preview 
  window.  Executing this on another package will update the preview window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *:PackageManUndo*
:|PackageManUndo|

  Completely undo the last change.  If a number of packages are marked 
  for install, this will reset them to their original state.

  Note: If you commit the changes, the you will need to commit the undo
  for it to have any effect. When marking a package for install, dependencies
  are automatically marked for installation.  Toggling the Install will only
  reset the package you toggle.  Undo however, will reset the package and all
  dependencies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *:PackageManPurgeAll*
:|PackageManPurgeAll|

  Where packages are visible in the **'r'** or removed state, this will
  mark all to be purged.  You must commit this before it will take effect.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *:PackageManNextMark*
                                                          *:PackageManPrevMark*
:|PackageManNextMark|
:|PackageManPrevMark|

  Navigate to the next or previous block of marked packages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *:PackageManRefresh*
:|PackageManRefresh|

  Using the _apt-get_ utility, this will retrieve the details of all known
  packages and import them.  This allows 'PackageMan!' to accurately
  display uninstalled packages.

                                                              *:PackageManView*
:|PackageManView|

  Display a preview of all changes which are pending for the next commit.

                                                           *:PackageManExecute*
:|PackageManExecute|

  Commit all changes and execute the command `apt-get dselect-upgrade`
  to trigger the installation/removal of packages.

    `[s` or `[c`   Navigate to the previous group of marked packages

=============================================================================
PERFORMANCE                                            *packageman-performance*

When using PackageMan to manage installed packages, things should be nice
and snappy with even a few thousand installed packages.

However... when using PackageMan! with the APT cache of all possible
packages, things get a tad slow. The problem lies in how a complete APT
cache currently has almost 50,000 packages, and PackageMan will be
managing potentially thousands of signs.

Hopefully this can be resolved with performance tweaks.. Most of the
issues occur during initial loading due to the overhead of parsing the
package data.
